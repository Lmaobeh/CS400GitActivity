There once was a man that went to school. He had dreams of his bright future. Fast cars, money, friends, and recognition, the stereyotyped dream created in the consumerist utopia. But alas, these were just his dreams, that might not even be his own. He attended school for a degree that he belived was the key to this consumer paridise. Each night e lay in bed, overcome with worry. And each moring he woke up drunk with depression. That was until he discovered, the lab.
The lab was filled with machines to the liking of which he had never seen before. Tucked away from the modern world this lab served a purpose, one way or another. The man found himself drawn to the mysterious purpose of this lab, even if he knew little of its capabilities. Before long he found himself spending more and more time within the lab until recently the man never left. It had become his home, or atleast something as close to home as he would ever find. It was only then that he realized everything had changed. 
Tucked away in the lab, the man began to sense an extreme feeling of deja vu. Clocks seemed to only move so far, things is the lab only changed by the slightest degree. Each machine he worked with didn't have instructions, but that didn't stop the man from turning dials and punching in code to the keypads. There was one machine the man loved. It was tall and round like that of a TSA secruity scanner. But instead of a revolving scan, a solid green beam would flow from the bottom throught the man until it reached the top. From there the man felt an amazing feeling of bliss. Like all of his daily burdens were washed away. Everyday, the man would run throughout the lab using all of the machines to accomplish tasks that only the mans desires knew the effect. But soon, the man begin to sense that something wasn't right.
